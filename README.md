Hi,
I am working on a project for model railroad DCC communication.
Idea is to make a simple controller, basestation that can send simple DCC commands for switching lights, turnout etc. 
it is gonna take me some time to make, but will be great... 
You will find some skeches with testing of timers counters and direct register I/O I have done because timing is very crucial here. 
The final "class" will be DCCtrain...
Feel free to follow the project.
If you want more information you can check my website www.wisselmotor.nl 
or send me an email to wisselmotor.nl@gmail.com. Or my account email. 
Thanks for reading.
